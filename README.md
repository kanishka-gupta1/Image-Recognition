## üìå Project Overview

# Image Recognition Bootcamp Project
This project was done as part of the **Build an AI That Sees** bootcamp.
  
The goal was to learn and implement **image recognition models** using deep learning techniques in Python.  
Over 5 days, we worked with three datasets to build, train, and evaluate image classification models:
- **MNIST**
- **CIFAR-10**
- **Cats vs Dogs**

The project covers:
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Building custom CNN models
- Using Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2)
- Model evaluation and visualization
- Making live predictions
